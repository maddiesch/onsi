Write code. Open a Pull Request ;)

Okay. So there's a bit more to it than that.

The best way to get started is checking out any good ['Starter Issues'](https://github.com/maddiesch/onsi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AStarter)

## Testing

Onsi uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info) for unit tests. Please make sure any code you add is properly tested.

## Documentation

Onsi uses [yard](https://yardoc.org) for documentation generation. Please make sure any code you add is properly documented.

#### Before opening a PR

1. Make sure the specs pass.

  `$ bundle exec rspec`

2. Make sure rubocop is happy(ish).

  `$ rubocop . --auto-correct`

3. Write a descriptive PR details :D
